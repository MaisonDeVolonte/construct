▸ GRAPH SPEC

GOAL:         import the backend repo into the frontend monorepo as an apps/api workspace,
              with history preserved and prod never down for more than a blip

CONTEXT:      1. git subtree is decided, over a fresh copy
              2. history must survive the import
              3. the frontend deploy must never fire on a backend-only commit
              4. the backend has never had an automated deploy
              5. prod runs from a server directory, not a checkout
              6. something unidentified also writes to that directory
              7. future hosting leans toward the cheaper vps option, per the repo owner
              8. facts 1-7 came from interrogating the user, not from either repo

DONE WHEN:    1. apps/api exists as a workspace in the monorepo
              2. git log inside apps/api reaches commits older than the import
              3. npm install passes from a fresh clone
              4. both builds pass from a fresh clone
              5. a green ci gate runs on apps/api/** paths
              6. one backend-only test push triggers no frontend deploy
              7. an uptime probe shows prod stayed up through the cutover

FAN OUT:      1. frontend auditor: workspace config, build wiring, every deploy trigger
              2. backend auditor: history size and shape, secrets in history, build steps
              3. import mechanic: subtree prefix layout, workspace wiring, install effects
              4. cutover planner: deploy isolation, path filters, the unexplained writer
              return shape: claim, evidence as file:line or a runnable command, confidence

RULES:        1. a finding without evidence does not survive verify
              2. propose nothing that cannot land within 2-3 prs
              3. never rewrite history, the import only adds commits
              4. the repo rename stays out of scope
              5. the backend deploy mechanism itself stays out of scope

VERIFY:       a fresh agent attacks each finding against DONE WHEN and CONTEXT
              evidence that fails to reproduce, or contradicts a known fact, kills the finding

OUTPUT:       docs/plans/2026-07-31-operation-monorepo.md, per plans.md, passing plans.sh
